# FurnitureInventoryManagerPro

FurnitureInventoryManagerPro is an object-oriented PHP web application using MySQL, and has a responsive design using Bootstrap 4. It is a continuation of the more basic FurnitureInventoryManager that uses a MySQL database instead of a simple CSV file.

Credentials are stored in `private/db_credentials.php`. To customize the application's credentials, the developer only needs to update this file.
